Water, water in the sea
Bring your creatures up to me
I pull them up, release my spawn (fish on)
Water, water soaky cloud
Help me get your creatures out
Let them come, release my spawn (fish on)
Fish on
Fish on
Fish on


I got my rod, I have my spear
I've ready set my
Moby's dick is out of sight
They find my Nemo every night fishing gear


Some are bigger, some are small
I don't care, I catch them all

Water, water in the sea
Bring your creatures up to me
I pull them up, release my spawn (fish on)
Water, water soaky cloud
Help me get your creatures out
Let them come, release my spawn (fish on)
Water, water in the sea
Let your mermaids all be free
I get it out, release my spawn (fish on)

Some are bigger, some are small
